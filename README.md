Welcome to the Giga Wolf game source code repository. Giga Wolf is a unique game prototype featuring automatic AI systems built on a modified Entity Component System (ECS) programming pattern.


## Gameplay

Giga Wolf offers two exciting game modes:

### Mode 1: The Wolf
In this mode, you step into the role of a wolf in a dynamic food chain simulation. Your goal is to survive and thrive by preying on sheep while avoiding dangerous bulls. You have a unique ability to freeze sheep temporarily, giving you an edge in the hunt.

### Mode 2: The Dog
Switch perspectives and become a dog, tasked with gathering all the sheep in a specific area and protecting them from the relentless wolf pack. You can freeze wolves briefly to keep the sheep safe, but you must act swiftly.
